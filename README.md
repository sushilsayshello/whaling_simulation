This project is a web-based simulation of a whaling attack targeting a high-profile individual, specifically Jeff Bezos. It showcases how phishing and non-phishing emails can be crafted and used in social engineering attacks. The simulation is interactive, colorful, and educational, aiming to demonstrate the sophistication of whaling tactics.
